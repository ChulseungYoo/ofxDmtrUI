# ofxDmtrUI

Made to be really simple and lightweight.  
It is my first public openFrameworks addon.  
Requires oF 0.9+  
Suggestions and code improvements will be greatly appreciated.  
Use by your own risk. It is working well here.
Tested on OS X. Let me know if you are using it. Examples will be created under demand

Sister Project:
https://github.com/dimitre/Cinder-DmtrUI


## Features
Load interface layouts from text files.
See section Text File Format in this README for more info

## Motivation
A C++ exercise for me  
first open source project, hope to get collaboration from skilled programmers  
lead an interface project from my own needs  
a way of quickly design a prototype interface and spend time in what matters  
a personal substitute for the beloved and deprecated ofxUI  
An UI that is not constantly redrawing on screen. each time one element is refreshed the screen is saved into an FBO.  
CPU usage is very low. 

## Dependencies
ofxXmlSettings  

# TODO
Different events for loading xml files and updating with the mouse.
add namespace to classes.  
test events in IOs
integration with ofxMidi for midi controllers use  

./Change some variables named in portuguese  
//radio buttons rectangles according to width.  
//radio images for presets.
//port to lib cinder  

# Future Ideas
Performance : maybe check inside panel rectangle if mouse event is inside before check in each panel element.
Implement the class Element and make pointers to member functions of draw, check mouse, get val etc.

## 2016 05 25
added saveX saveY and restoreX restoreY  
updating software for The Year club.  
upgrading ofxDmtrUIMidiController.  

## 2016 05 20
new addon to interface this addon with midi controller
https://github.com/dimitre/ofxDmtrUIMidiController

## 2016 05 20
function clear added. clear all sliders and variables, reset flow.x e flow.y to be ready to build other kinds of elements.

## 2016 05 13
Possibility of coloring down some radio options. Made for Mareh Festival, a visual shortcut to moving heads color wheel options.
Happy, the second commercial project using the interface.

## 2016 05 12
Under demand for Marisco Festival next weekend: Multiple options radio. flowing like a text and saving booleans. saving space too.

## 2016 05 10
Slider2d now working OK, saving and loading
fbo element now possible. just display some FBO in your interface.

In the meantime I’ve written Cinder-DmtrUI as a simple UI for Cinder too. I’ve started by other approach and I like it very much. I’ll try to convert some ideas and concepts from there to here in the near future.

## Text File Format
Text files are a custom format like TSV <tab separated values>
```
label	ofxDmtrUI
label	Code Dmtr.org 2016

marginy	100
label	First Column
float	r	0 255 127
float	g	0 255 127
float	b	0 255 127
radio	speed2shortcut	1 2 4 8

float	DivNoiseX	0 1 .2
float	DivNoiseY	0 1 .2
bool	toggle1
bool	toggle2
bool	toggle3
bool	ok	1
bool	ok2	1
```

Setup values, values that doesn’t display anything but changes the variables in UI instance.
rect<tab>x y width height
```
rect	240 20 840 940
```
defines the interface rectangle, useful when using more than one UI instance, distributing rectangles on the screen.
```
marginx	20
marginy	280
sliderWidth	240
```
changes the rectangle margins and redefine sliderWidth
```
label	Fita 1
float	posicao1	0 1 0
int	divisao1	1 8 1
float	pan1	-1 1 -.5
float	vol1	0 1 1
```
create a label “Fita 1”
a float variable called “posicao1” with min = 0, max = 1, def = 0
```
newcol
label	Fita 2
float	posicao2	0 1 0
```
newcol jumps to a new column to add more widgets.

```
radio	speed2shortcut	1 2 4 8
```

Radio create a radio with n parameters separated by space. useful to list numbers or words in the software
accessible in the map ui.pString[name]


```
dirlist	fita1	/Users/dd/Desktop/WORK_DMTR/AREIA_AUDIO
```
dirlist creates a radio with files listed in a specific directory, relative or absolute path.
